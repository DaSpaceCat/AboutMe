        Hi! I'm Rhiannon / Renii! I'm a 15 year old chill trans furry who likes to meet new people. 
        <br>My fursona is an avali, (pictured above) but i can also be a protogen or doe sometimes :)
        <br>I love to play games, mainly tetris, SAR (Super Animal Royale), and Apex Legends. (oh also titanfall 2)
        <br>I'm open to DMs, but keep in mind that i have social anxiety and can be pretty sensitive. 
        <br>You'll probably only ever find me chatting on Discord or Telegram, tags to which can be found below.
        <br>I use she/her or they/them pronouns
        <br>and my birthday is on July 9th
      </p>
